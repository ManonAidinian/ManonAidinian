### Hi there I'm Manon ðŸ‘‹

I have spent 10 incredible years working as project manager in the fashion industry.

I am in love with the exciting process of building a product, thrilled with the potential of Tech and I got completely hooked on programming, so I decided to make the career shift and enrolled in a 9 weeks Web Developement bootcamp with Le Wagon:

Here are the process and tech stack I'm most familiar with :

User journey | Prototyping in Figma | DB Schema and PostgreSQL | MVC pattern with Ruby on Rails | Auth. with Devise | Javascript + Stimulus JS | Geocoding with Mapbox | Action cable | APIs | PG Search | SCSS | GitHub | Cloudinary | Heroku

ðŸš€ I am now a certified Junior Full-stack Developer, working on personal projects to keep learning every day, and looking forward to joining a new team where I can contribute to building valuable products!
